I am glad that I can still write and get the idea published.

It was the beginning of 2020 while I was in the train before Covid-19 outbreak in the country. "How to explain what can and cannot a hydraulic model do?" in a more sensible way to the general public was the initial objective of this.

How about writing an article? - got an immediate positive response from the person in charged.

This piece took about a year from drafting to publishing. There were numerous times of re-reading, rephrasing, restructuring before I could show the first draft to my co-author. And we reiterate the process. To me, writing is not merely about the content and audience, it is also about self-assessment and self-reflection that help me becoming a better person and writer.
