I had a lot of funs exploring different projections in Week 2 of Esri MOOC Cartography.

Spilhaus World Ocean Map in Square Projection is specially designed to present the oceans in a more engaging way.
Several layers and techniques are employed in this map,
- [Spilhaus World Ocean Map](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/756bcae18d304a1eac140f19f4d5cb3d),  
- [Land areas hand-drawn](https://www.projectlinework.org/) by cartographer Dylan Moriarty,  
- [Bathymetric or the underwater terrain DEM](https://www.gebco.net/) by GEBCO,  
- major ocean currents by Marine Conservation Institute.

Check out John Nelson's [oceanic maps](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/spilhaus-more-like-thrillhaus/). The Spilhaus projection was created by Athelstan Spilhaus in 1942!

While I was looking for more supporting facts on how do large-scale ocean currents affecting climate,
why winter in England is always warmer compared with other places at the same latitude. 
Instead, I found a piece of interesting news reported almost 20 years ago:
**Britain's moderate climate is due to the Rocky Mountains in the western U.S. but not the Gulf Stream?!**

Find out more about the Rocky Mountains and Britain warm winter [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/forget-about-the-gulf-stream-britain-is-really-kept-warm-in-winter-by-the-rocky-mountains-118560.html).
