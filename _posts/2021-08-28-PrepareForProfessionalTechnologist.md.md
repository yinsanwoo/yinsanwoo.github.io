To date, if you hold an MEng with outstanding engineering experiences, without a BEng, you are unqualified to register as a Graduate Engineer with the Board of Engineers Malaysia. Not to mention registering as a PEng via the GE route. BEM accepts the only BTech accredited by the Board’s Engineering Technology Accreditation Council (ETAC) or a signatory of Sydney Accord.

If you hold a BTech with at least 3 years of experience and would like to be recognized by the Malaysian government, this post might provide a little help. The Malaysia Board of Technologists (MBOT) does register and recognize your knowledge and skills as a professional - Professional Technologist (PTech or Ts.). The following is summarized from the journeys of several PTech.

#### 𝗗𝘂𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀
- Graduate Technologist registration and approval, 1 month
- PTech assessment and approval, 1 month
- Interview and official PTech status, 2 months
MBOT will update the candidate of each application status via email

#### 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱
- Second chance to polish and submit your latest resume
- Duration: 30 min to 1 hr
- Interviewers: 2 to 3, might be the same or different fields from the candidate 
- Questions (based on the areas of assessment):
  - Personal: motivation of becoming a PTech, experience/research, CPD plans, leadership, contributions (past, present and future) to the field, challenges
  - General: Act 768, MBOT, Code of Ethics, IR 4.0, PTech vs PEng

#### 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝘁𝗶𝗽𝘀
- know your interviewers, at least names beforehand
- be honest
- have self-confidence (don't use or reduce 'I think/guess so')
- answer professionally (don't be defensive)

Feel free to drop me a line if you would like to know more about my PTech journey.
